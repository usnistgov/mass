dtest pixels for metrology array
-	Mn + Cu target with easyXAFS XCP-Pd
-	Best channels: 4102, 4109
-	On pcuser@687harpy in /data/20230626/0000 and 0001 (noise and pulses, respectively)
Channel 4102 has some spiky garbage in the noise psd, but still got good resolution. I only fit the Cu Ka line, where it was about 3.2 eV. Channel 4109 has a cleaner noise spectrum but slightly worse energy resolution (3.4 eV at Cu Ka), and it required a sizable phase correction to get decent energy resolution.
