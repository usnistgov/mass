HOW TO INSTALL MASS
=========================

Mass is a pure-Python system for analyzing microcalorimeter data.
(It's possible that we'll want to convert some code to C or Cython
at some time in the near future...)

The preferred approach is simply to use python setuptools to 
copy the Mass code to the known, standard install location.  You will
probably need sudo power to do this, but the process is otherwise
very simple.  From the top-level Mass directory (where you find this
file), you need only one command:

$ sudo python setup.py install

If you wish to test Mass without installing, or if you wish to play
with the latest edition from subversion, then I suggest that you
modify your PYTHONPATH shell variable.  The Mass code lives in
./src/mass/ (were "." refers to the location of this INSTALL file).
You just need your PYTHONPATH to point to this.  If you use bash, and
supposing that your NIST software repository lives in ~/trunk, then
you should add the following to your .bashrc file:

$ -

One problem with running a test version of Mass is that the compiled
extensions do not get built into the "live" tree.  One possible workaround:

$ export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:~/trunk/python/mass/build/lib*/mass/mathstat/

Or another is just to copy the compiled extensions into the live tree:
$ cp build/lib*/mass/mathstat/*so mass/mathstat/ 

Let me know what works for you!


HOW TO IMPORT MASS WITHIN PYTHON/IPYTHON
=========================================

>>> import mass




PACKAGE DEPENDENCIES
=====================

Mass has a few required packages, though I expect they are mostly things
that any physicist would already have when using Python for scientific
work:

o- numpy
o- scipy
o- matplotlib (a.k.a. pylab)
o- cython
o- gcc with gfortran
o- Qt4 (optional) 
o- PyQt4 (optional)

The Qt4 packages are optional in the sense that the optional GUI is
built on PyQt4.  You can certainly use mass without the GUI, in which
case the matplotlib plotting package is free to use a non-Qt backend.
I would not do this is you don't have to.  As of late April 2012, I
am finally adding useful GUI components.

I am sure that Mass uses certain features of each package that are
only available starting with certain version numbers.  Unfortunately,
I have no idea what they are.  I can say that at the time of this
writing (April 23, 2012), my own computer uses versions: 

o- python     2. 7.3
o- ipython    0.12.2
o- numpy      1. 6.1
o- scipy      0.10.1
o- matplotlib 1. 1.0
o- cython	  0.15.0
o- PyQt4      4. 9.1
o- Qt4        4. 7.4
o- gcc        4. 5.3

Note from Rob Horansky (uninformed user) 11/18/11 With Macports try: 
$ sudo port install gcc45
$ sudo port select gcc mp-gcc45


    Matplotlib preferences
    ---------------------------

The Qt4 GUI features will conflict with your matplotlib GUI
unless you are using Qt4 as your "backend" for matplotlib.  You can
specify this by using the following line in your configuration file,
which is generally ~/.matplotlib/matplotlibrc :

backend     : Qt4Agg

Here are some other things I find very useful in that file but which
have nothing to do with Mass:

interactive : True
keymap.grid : g                     # switching on/off a grid in current axes
keymap.yscale : l                   # toggle scaling of y-axes ('log'/'linear')
keymap.xscale : L, k                # toggle scaling of x-axes ('log'/'linear')


ECLIPSE
=======

To work on the Fortran90 code in Mass, you might want to find Photran, a FORTRAN 
back end for Eclipse.  See
