          MASS: The Microcalorimeter Analysis Software Suite

Mass is a software suite to analyze data from microcalorimeters.  It
is meant to be exactly as general as NIST users and their
collaborators require, without being any more general than that.  

With Mass and a little bit of Python knowledge, you can:
o- Process data from one or multiple detectors at one time.
o- Analyze data from normal TDM systems or from flux-summed CDM.
o- Choose data cuts.
o- Compute and apply "optimal filters" of various types.
o- Win friends and influence people.

As of this writing (October 25, 2011), it is 6775 lines of Python.
I sometimes consider extensions in C, C++, or Cython for performance
reasons, but no such extensions have been written nor needed to date.

Mass is being developed from a personal project to a system that can
be shared by microcalorimeters users at NIST and elsewhere.  This step
is new in October 2011, so please be patient!  Let the author know
what's missing or wrong or useful.


DOCUMENTATION
=============

        Docstrings
        ----------

The most complete documentation (though certainly not complete) can be
found in the docstrings that accompany every (well, almost every)
module, class, function, and method in the system.  Thus:

>>> import mass
>>> help mass.TESGroup
>>> help data.datasets[0].obscure_method_name

(Notice that help is a built-in function, and if you don't run in
ipython, then you'll have to surround the argument with parentheses.
Ipython, being totally sweet, will do this for you.)



        Doxygen site
        ------------

If you have the subversion version of mass (trunk/python/mass), then
the subdirectory doc contains configuration and a Makefile to generate
a local copy of a doxygen website.  For a mac:

$ cd ~/trunk/python/mass/doc
$ make doc
$ open -n html/index.html

For linux, I think you can replace the last with "firefox
html/index.html", but I can't say for sure.

This is probably more useful to someone planning to add code to Mass
than to the casual user.  Still, it's kind of fun to see what doxygen
can do more or less by magic.

I will try to copy the doxygen site to the group webserver someday,
and to keep it updated.  More on that later.


        Tutorials and demos
        -------------------

Ummm.... I'm working on this, really.
