# Pass One HDF5 Files
===========

This file will document the required structure and contents for the HDF5 files generated by Pass One processing on raw data files.

Any framework that can generate this HDF5 file from a set of raw data files (LJH or otherwise) will be considered a valid Pass One framework. 
We'll not require bit-by-bit compatibility in the datasets, which means that multiple ''valid'' Pass One programs can disagree on the
exact HDF5 file they produce.

Possible Pass One Pulse Examination (POPE) systems might include:

1. Galen's real-time POPE, now largely working, written in Julia.

1. A POPE.py, which might be "part of MASS", written in Python, controlled by a simple YAML configuration file, and run without other intervention.
