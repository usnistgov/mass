On branch `hdf5_only` I (Galen) have implemented the ability to work from only hdf5 files, but some things may not work.

There is a new type `TESGroupHDF5` that inherits from `TESGroup`. It has only one constructor, `TESGroupHDF5(filename)`
where `filename` is the filename of the master hdf5 file. In a `TESGroup` you can get the filename by
`data.hdf5_file.filename`. There a bit of extra work required to use hdf5 files from julia.

To do hdf5 file only with hdf5 files generated by python mass do:

```python
data = mass.TESGroupHDF5(filename)
```

To do hdf5 file only with hdf5 file generated by julia Mass2 do something like:

```python
h5filenames = ['/Users/oneilg/.julia/v0.4/ReferenceMicrocalFiles/ljh/20150707_D_chan13.hdf5']
h5master_fname=mass.make_or_get_master_hdf5_from_julia_hdf5_file(h5filenames,forceNew=True)
data = mass.TESGroupHDF5(h5master_fname)
```

Obviously, if you have different hdf5 filenames than in the example, and especially if you have more than one, you
will have to do a bit more work.
